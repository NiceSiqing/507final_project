I got 25$ off the (excellent) buffet as part of the FHR program, and 60$ in breakfast credit the following morning which I used at Tableau; I also got 100$ to use at the spa/salon, so I got a pedicure. The property had strong wifi, good water temperature/pressure, and was quiet and comfortable at night. Cannot wait to come back, as it feels like a real getaway to come here.¡­",Las Vegas
